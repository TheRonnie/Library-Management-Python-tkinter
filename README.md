# Library-Management-Python-tkinter

>In this project, a Library Book Management System will be implemented with the front end GUI developed using Tkinter and the backend database implemented in SQLite. It is a single window tkinter GUI application which will implement CRUD( create, read, update, delete) operations on a ‘books’ database, in SQLite. The window will contain text widgets to accept / display book title, author, year of publication, ISBN (optional) and a large text area/ list box to display the records which match the search criteria.

I'll be building a Library Book Management System using Python's Tkinter library for the graphical user interface (GUI) and SQLite for the backend database. The application will allow users to perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on a database of books.

Here's a breakdown of what the application will feature:

1. **Frontend GUI with Tkinter**: Tkinter is a standard GUI toolkit for Python. You'll be using it to create the graphical interface for your Library Book Management System.

2. **Backend Database with SQLite**: SQLite is a lightweight, file-based SQL database engine. It's perfect for small to medium-sized applications like this one.

3. **CRUD Operations**: The application will allow users to perform the following operations on the database:
   - **Create**: Add new books to the database.
   - **Read**: Display information about existing books.
   - **Update**: Modify information about existing books.
   - **Delete**: Remove books from the database.

4. **Data Fields**: Users will be able to input and view information about books, including:
   - Book Title
   - Author
   - Year of Publication
   - ISBN (optional)

5. **Search Functionality**: The application will include a feature to search for books based on certain criteria. The matching records will be displayed in a large text area or list box within the GUI.

To implement this project, I'll need to design the GUI using Tkinter, set up the SQLite database, and write the necessary Python code to handle CRUD operations and search functionality. I'll also need to handle user inputs, validation, and error handling.
