# Library-Management-Python-tkinter

>In this project, a Library Book Management System will be implemented with the front end GUI developed using Tkinter and the backend database implemented in SQLite. It is a single window tkinter GUI application which will implement CRUD( create, read, update, delete) operations on a ‘books’ database, in SQLite. The window will contain text widgets to accept / display book title, author, year of publication, ISBN (optional) and a large text area/ list box to display the records which match the search criteria.
